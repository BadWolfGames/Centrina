There was once a time in a universe far far away that we used to have a CMS ToDo list,
but all was lost to the traveler once the dragon came to be on a dark stormy night.
That and everyone forgot their password, so hue hue.

[CORE]
-Add language module for multiple language support and to translate error messages. [4]
//-Add global setting thingy. [2] - Not what I originally had in mind, but it works and it's simple.
-Rewrite the config system [2] - Just convert a INI file with the settings to PHP and save it, do some simple CRC checks to see if the file changed or not.

[MODULES]
-Write Katarina template engine. [4] - Isn't really needed now-a-days, but it'd still be cool to code.

//-Rewrite token system.

//-Add reset password (generate random password) [2] - Almost done, just need email up and running.
